# CHVIM
CHVIM is a vim profile switcher inspired by [CHEMACS](https://github.com/plexus/chemacs)
With enough luck, your favorite vim config is directory-agnostic and can be used in conjunction with CHVIM
## Installation
1. Put your ~/.vimrc, ~/.vim, or ~/.config/nvim somewhere safe.
2. Add the path to your vimrc or init.vim in a file called `~/.vim-profiles`
3. `git clone https://github.com/faerryn/chvim.git $HOME/.vim` for VIM or `git clone https://github.com/faerryn/chvim.git $HOME/.config/nvim`
4. `vim` or `nvim` and select your config!
## Usage
Put all your different `vimrc`s and `init.vim`s in ~/.vim-profiles

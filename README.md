# CHVIM
[CHVIM is a state in which one can break free of all known laws and corruptions of Oblivion. It allows for the user to return to a state before the mingling of Anu and Padomay and manipulate the Aurbis how they please. CHIM is often associated with Love, which seemingly connects it to the concept of God actually being "Love."](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/CHIM)
